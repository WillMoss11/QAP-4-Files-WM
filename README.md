JavaScript:
This code defines a "MotelCustomer" with attributes for a motel customer and methods to calculate the age and duration of stay, as well as to generate a description of the customer. It then creates a sample customer object and logs the generated description. Also you can embed this in HTML by creating a function that generates HTML based on the customer object's properties.
